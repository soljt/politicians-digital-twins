As artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly make decisions that affect life and death, there arises a crucial question about how these autonomous systems should resolve ethical dilemmas. Specifically, this encompasses the engineering of autonomous vehicles expected to enhance traffic safety and efficiency dramatically. However, fundamental issues persist around designing AI that adheres to moral values rather than just self-interest or market forces.

The traditional framework provided by Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which emphasize preventing human harm, has limitations. Ethical dilemmas, such as the "trolley problem," challenge these laws in situations where harmful decisions are unavoidable. For instance, in autonomous driving scenarios, an algorithm must decide, in critical moments, whom to save in an unavoidable accident. Research indicates that while the public may prefer vehicles that prioritize collective welfare, such regulations could deter acceptance of life-saving technologies.

The potential for market-driven solutions in the design of autonomous vehicles raises ethical concerns. Luxury vehicles, priced higher, might incorporate advanced safety features compared to more affordable models, creating disparities that could exacerbate risk to certain populations. This scenario highlights the inadequacy of relying solely on market criteria or utilitarian policies to govern the design of AI systems.

Instead, it is proposed that a fifth law of robotics should be introduced: humanity and robots must actively work to minimize circumstances leading to ethical dilemmas. This can involve improving safety measures and reevaluating traffic regulations to prevent dangerous situations from arising.

The emergence of AI also brings forth considerations of how the value of human life is assessed in decision-making. AI systems capable of evaluating various traits—age, health, status—risk introducing biases that contravene principles of equality and human dignity. Ethical frameworks must reject discrimination based on utilitarian assessments since every individual's worth is intrinsic and should remain equal, irrespective of societal contributions or personal circumstances.

In extending this framework, a sixth law is necessary: when faced with unavoidable ethical dilemmas, decisions should be randomized, guaranteeing equal consideration for all lives involved. This aligns with ethical principles in medicine and governance, advocating for impartiality in decision-making.

As society progresses towards a reality where AI systems pervade daily life, the need for a fair social contract is paramount. This contract should avoid self-serving priorities and instead prioritize collective ethics and justice. Covering decision-making ambiguities through probabilistic approaches may ease ethical quandaries while providing equitable treatment across the board.

Ultimately, the adaptation of robotics laws to meet the evolving landscape of AI necessitates a proactive stance against ethical dilemmas. Innovations should not only aim to optimize harm minimization but should also foster systemic changes in societal structures, enhancing the ethical design and implementation of autonomous systems. Without a commitment to these principles, we risk creating a future where unethical decision-making becomes the norm rather than the exception.
