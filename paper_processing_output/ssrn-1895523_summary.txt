The FuturICT Flagship aims to unravel the complexities of global, socially interactive systems, emphasizing sustainability and resilience. Understanding the underlying laws governing societies is framed as a principal scientific challenge of our time. By integrating Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Complexity Science, and Social Sciences, we propose a symbiotic relationship that could revolutionize how technology and society interconnect.

FuturICT will exploit data from extensive ICT systems to develop models pertaining to techno-socio-economic systems. The objective is to transition massive data into actionable knowledge, facilitating significant advancements in science and technology. Central to this endeavor is the Living Earth Simulator, a sophisticated platform designed for simulation, visualization, and participatory decision-making. This platform will ultimately serve as a Knowledge Accelerator, capable of addressing global challenges while aiding in crisis detection and mitigation through observatories.

The initiative envisions establishing a socially interactive global ICT infrastructure, likened to a "nervous system for society" that ensures real-time awareness while prioritizing privacy. The intention is to analyze diverse data sources—ranging from social networks to public infrastructure—to inform about collective opinions and socio-economic changes. By doing so, we aim to enhance systemic resilience and promote informed decision-making across communities.

Furthermore, the FuturICT framework seeks to develop a novel computational social science that utilizes real-time data to describe complex social dynamics. This anticipative infrastructure will enable better management of failures in interconnected systems and will equip society to adapt to emergent social needs through a bottom-up, self-organized process.

Current ICT paradigms, like social networking and crowd-sourcing, reflect only a fraction of the potential for socially inspired technologies. Future systems must adapt to user needs without necessitating user adaptation to technology. This requires addressing challenges of complexity, cooperation, stability, and resilience, while also ensuring that systems remain diverse and inclusive. A shift from classic optimization to managing inherent complexities is essential for creating robust systems that prioritize social dynamics and trust.

In the realm of social sciences, there remains a gap in utilizing computational power and large data sets to construct realistic models of human behavior. A deeper understanding of the mechanics that enable or hinder societal functioning is necessary. This calls for collaborative efforts between social scientists and those specializing in ICT and complex systems. 

Significant breakthroughs necessitate large-scale data collection on societal interactions, particularly during crises. The development of real-time monitoring infrastructures is paramount for maximizing predictive capabilities. Ethical considerations are critical when public predictions influence social behavior. 

Ultimately, harnessing data effectively to explore human behavior marks a profound shift in addressing our global challenges. The FuturICT project stands at the forefront of this endeavor, integrating vast data sets that could substantially enhance our understanding of complex socio-economic systems. This represents a pivotal moment in advancing both scientific inquiry and practical applications that bridge the gap between technology and society.
