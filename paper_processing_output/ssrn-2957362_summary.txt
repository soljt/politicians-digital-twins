This study investigates the connection between public debate in the media and asylum acceptance rates in Europe from 2002 to 2016, highlighting significant disparities among countries despite a unified legal framework. Empirical evidence shows that acceptance rates for asylum seekers vary widely across European nations, which should theoretically be consistent based on international laws. A data-driven approach is employed, analyzing refugee-related news articles in conjunction with asylum decision data to explore the influence of public sentiment on national policies.

Key insights reveal that media sentiment is a strong predictor of asylum practices, surpassing social, cultural, and economic factors. Our findings indicate that negative sentiment in media correlates with lower acceptance rates for asylum seekers. By combining various measures of public discourse, we achieve high predictive accuracy of asylum acceptance rates within a 3% margin. The analysis also confirms that public debate in the media serves as a better predictor of asylum practices than traditional explanatory variables.

Furthermore, the sentiment expressed in media plays a more significant role than mere volume in predicting acceptance trends, aligning with existing theories that suggest negative media portrayals can lead to adverse policy responses. This point underscores the media's potential power in shaping public attitudes and, subsequently, political actions regarding asylum policies.

Through Granger-causality tests, the research establishes a clear directional influence from public debate sentiment to asylum acceptance rates, rather than the reverse. This supports the notion that public discourse in the media informs and shapes policy decisions rather than reflecting pre-existing governmental stances.

The implications of these findings emphasize the media's critical role as a bridge between public sentiment and political action, particularly regarding asylum seekers, a group often subject to variable national policies despite a common humanitarian legal framework. This analysis allows for future explorations into the mechanisms driving public debate, the role of social media, and potential divergences in response to diverse refugee profiles across different European nations. Overall, the evidence suggests an urgent need for policymakers to consider the relationship between media discourse and asylum practices as they navigate complex humanitarian challenges within Europe.
