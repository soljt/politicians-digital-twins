Power is a crucial factor influencing human behavior, particularly in bargaining situations. Existing theories often overlook the nuanced role of power in shaping social preferences, which are vital for explaining behaviors in experimental settings like the Ultimatum Game (UG). Our research aims to elucidate how bargaining power affects these social preferences, specifically in a Generalized Ultimatum Game (GUG) format.

In the standard Ultimatum Game, players typically exhibit fairness-oriented behavior contrary to selfish rationality assumptions, often rejecting inequitable offers. This behavior has been attributed to other-regarding preferences that prioritize fairness over self-interest. However, our findings demonstrate that while the offers and acceptance rates adjust according to power dynamics, the underlying social preferences—measured through donations to charitable organizations—remain constant regardless of power levels.

The experiments we conducted involved modifying the pay-off structure of the UG to observe behaviors under different power balances: one where the proposer or responder has more power and a balanced scenario. Results revealed predictable variations in offers and acceptance rates with the manipulation of power. Notably, acceptance rates remained high for lower offers, deviating from classical UG predictions, suggesting that fairness motivations may not fluctuate with power.

Power affects cognitive functions, such as increasing top-down control and altering how individuals respond to social cues. Some literature posits that higher social status leads to more anti-social behavior, whereas other findings indicate that individuals with a communal orientation may act altruistically when empowered. Our study supports the hypothesis that social behaviors and preferences can be context-dependent, influenced more by societal norms and framing than by power itself.

In our anonymous and double-blind studies, we ensured that the findings reflect true behavioral tendencies, less influenced by social pressures or informal norms of restraint. Despite variations in bargaining behavior due to power shifts, our research indicates that other-regarding preferences and pro-social behavior remain invariant. Participants' willingness to make charitable donations did not correlate with their assigned power, challenging assumptions that power inevitably skews altruistic tendencies.

These findings highlight the complexity of social interactions and emphasize the need to further investigate the intersections of power, behavior, and social preferences. Understanding these relationships could yield insights into the mechanisms underpinning human cooperation and fairness in various social contexts. Future research should explore the evolutionary underpinnings of these preferences and the implications for societal dynamics, emphasizing the importance of context in determining behaviors that extend beyond the mere exertion of power.
