The evolutionary dynamics of moral standards reveal critical insights into cooperation and behavior in social interactions. Human behavior often struggles with the management of shared resources, leading to scenarios like the tragedy of the commons, where self-interest overrides collective welfare. To address this, we employ an evolutionary game-theoretical framework to examine how different behavioral strategies succeed within populations, including non-cooperative individuals (defectors), cooperators, moralists who punish defectors, and immoralists who punish other defectors despite being non-cooperative themselves.

Our agent-based model indicates that spatial interactions significantly affect systemic outcomes. Moralists can effectively eliminate cooperators through the process of group segregation, where the spatial distribution of behaviors allows them to thrive in the presence of defectors. This setup resolves the second-order free-rider problem, as moralists leverage their strategy to reinforce cooperation by punishing defectors. The presence of defectors can paradoxically pave the way for moralists’ proliferation, as they create a competitive landscape that enhances moral behavior.

Through our simulations, we observe that outcomes vary dramatically based on the structures and dynamics of interactions. The “who laughs last laughs best” phenomenon emerges, highlighting that moralists may start at a disadvantage yet ultimately prevail long-term as they better exploit dynamic conditions. Additionally, small mutation rates, introducing occasional defectors, can stimulate the spread of moral standards, an observation we refer to as “Lucifer’s positive side effect.” 

The dual relationship between moralists and immoralists also presents an interesting dynamic where moralists can benefit from immoralists’ punitive actions against defectors. This cooperation, termed “unholy collaboration,” signifies how complex social structures can enable otherwise conflicting strategies to coexist.

The crucial role of spatial or network interactions emerges as a guiding principle in understanding behavioral evolution. The decline of cooperation in large, well-mixed populations contrasts dramatically with the thriving cooperation observed in smaller, localized interactions. As moralists manage to crowd out non-punishing cooperators, the mechanisms of social sanctions can stabilize moral behaviors and contribute to the emergence of shared norms.

Our findings indicate that careful tuning of interaction parameters, such as punishment costs and fines, can foster the conditions necessary for moralist dominance in populations. The interplay of strategy adoption and the environment highlights the need for more nuanced models that integrate social dynamics, facilitating further investigation into the evolutionary processes underlying morality and cooperation in complex societies.

In summarizing, we illustrate that a deeper understanding of moral dynamics, underpinned by the theoretical and empirical investigation of spatial interactions, enables a richer exploration of the mechanisms driving cooperation and collective action across various biological and social systems. These insights pave the way for future studies elucidating the origins and evolution of moral behavior within human and animal communities alike.
