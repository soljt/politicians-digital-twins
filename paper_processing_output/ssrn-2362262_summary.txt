The analytical core of sociology suggests that social life arises from two principal sources: the similarity of individual consciousness and the division of social labor. Building upon classical sociological theory, we present a model that synthesizes insights from key theorists such as Durkheim, Weber, and Parsons, integrated with modern analytical tools including decision theory, game theory, and general equilibrium theory.

Our social equilibrium model extends the Walrasian economic equilibrium framework, conceptualizing society as a complex adaptive system that can be analyzed through agent-based models and evolutionary game theory. Fundamental to this approach is the understanding that human societies not only engage in self-interested behaviors but also possess intrinsic motivations for cooperation and social norms that govern behavior. We emphasize that social norms emerge from the interplay of individual rationality and collective action, influenced by cultural and institutional factors.

Gene-culture coevolution is foundational to our understanding of human social behavior, proposing that human cognition and morality have evolved through a dynamic interplay between genetic inheritance and cultural transmission. This process shapes other-regarding preferences, enabling society to thrive through cooperation, fairness, and the capacity for moral judgments.

Rational choice theory is adapted to incorporate moral values, suggesting that individual preferences are not solely driven by self-interest but also by social and ethical considerations. This broader framework accounts for behaviors shaped by norms, identity, and the social context in which choices are made. The notion of a preference function, which captures the complexity of human motivations, underlines that decision-makers may react differently depending on their situational context.

The social division of labor plays a crucial role in the formation of social roles, which define the expectations and norms associated with various positions within society. In equilibrium, these roles are public knowledge, shaping the interactions and expectations among social actors. Changes in role content often occur during periods of social upheaval, necessitating dialogue and negotiation among society's members.

As we move beyond static models, we examine the dynamical aspects of societal behavior. The capacity to model social dynamics remains a challenge due to the emergent properties that characterize complex systems. However, a better understanding of how social roles and institutions interact can illuminate how societies respond to change.

An important insight is that social norms function as correlated equilibria in strategic interactions, whereby adherence to norms is not merely a function of external rewards but also arises from internalized commitments to ethical behavior. This suggests that that individuals can act pro-socially, even when such actions conflict with immediate self-interest. The validity of social norms relies on their perceived legitimacy and the moral commitments of individuals towards them.

Ultimately, the development of a core analytical theory for sociology should aim to encompass both the empirical realities of human behavior and the theoretical foundations necessary for coherent explanations. Our analytical framework is intended to serve as a launching point for further investigation and refinement, advancing the scientific study of social phenomena.
