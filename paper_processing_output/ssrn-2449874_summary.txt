This paper discusses numerous strategies to enhance the resilience of the financial architecture, drawing on insights from a survey conducted among financial experts. A primary concern is the inadequacy of current mark-to-market accounting practices, which fail to account for the negative repercussions of liquidating large positions in illiquid markets. The proposed solution is to adopt impact-adjusted mark-to-market accounting that considers expected liquidation costs, thereby providing better warnings against excessive leverage and preventing potentially catastrophic financial scenarios.

Another key proposition is restricting bank lending to be based on sustainable income flows rather than speculative asset appreciation. This aims to break the perilous cycle of increasing leverage that drives asset bubbles, ultimately leading to financial crises. A more prudent approach requires banks to evaluate lending predominantly based on the income generated by projects instead of collateral values, ensuring that bank financing contributes to real economic growth.

Aligning bank managers' incentives with broader societal interests rather than solely with shareholder profit is also critical. By reconfiguring remuneration structures to include risks linked to the bank's stability, the proposal advocates for a shift in managerial priorities that discourages excessive risk-taking, thus advancing financial stability.

The paper further highlights the law-finance paradox, which states that rigid enforcement of legal commitments can exacerbate crises during periods of uncertainty. To address this, it suggests creating flexible regulatory frameworks that include safety valves, which would allow institutions to adapt their contracts in response to changing market conditions, ultimately managing systemic risks more effectively.

Mandatory issuance of contingent convertible bonds (CoCos) for systemically important financial institutions is advocated as a mechanism to align risk and accountability. These bonds would automatically convert into equity when capital falls below a certain threshold, incentivizing better risk management by shareholders.

The paper also calls for the establishment of electronic certificates to modernize financial transactions, thereby improving market liquidity and efficiency. Moving from paper-based documentation to a digital framework would streamline trading operations and enhance price discovery, thereby promoting a healthier financial system.

Moreover, it suggests implementing a global information system to aggregate and disseminate economic data. This would support improved decision-making and reduce uncertainty for market participants, facilitating informed actions and stabilizing market behaviors.

Lastly, it warns against excessive correlation in trading behaviors due to herding effects. Random trading mechanisms are proposed to mitigate this, by introducing an element of unpredictability that could deter speculative bubbles and promote stability in financial markets.

The overarching philosophy of this work emphasizes the need for innovative regulatory approaches and mechanisms that enhance the stability and resilience of the financial system, while ensuring that financial services align with the broader interests of society. By incorporating these multifaceted strategies, we can work towards creating a more robust and accountable financial architecture capable of withstanding future shocks.
