The digital revolution is transforming economic structures, societal institutions, and business models through advancements in Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. This era is marked by a profound shift toward "Attention Economy" and "Surveillance Capitalism," which introduces systemic changes characterized by increased data, speed, and interconnectedness. The text outlines two paradigms: a centralized, data-driven model focused on optimization and control, and a decentralized model emphasizing empowerment, cooperation, and collective intelligence.

It is evident that traditional economic theories, often predicated on the selfish "homo economicus," are inadequate to explain contemporary human behavior. New insights from behavioral economics reveal that individuals often exhibit fairness and cooperative instincts, suggesting that humans are better characterized as "homo socialis." This shift in perspective highlights the significance of self-regulation and local interactions in resolving social dilemmas and fostering cooperation. 

However, the rapid advancements in digital technologies have outpaced the evolution of economic theory. Existing institutions and sectors, including governance and healthcare, are being reinvented while economic theories remain largely unchanged. A pressing need for an updated understanding of economics—referred to as Economics 2.0—is highlighted, as the digital landscape demands new frameworks to account for personalized products and services.

Digital data has become a vital asset, propelling companies that collect vast amounts of personal information. The emergence of "Surveillance Capitalism" indicates that users are often profiled for targeted advertising, leading to manipulative practices such as personalized pricing. This risks exacerbating inequalities, as information asymmetry can create discriminatory outcomes where algorithmic decisions could favor or penalize individuals based on their data profiles.

The concept of "code is law" underscores the role of algorithms in shaping social and economic realities, raising concerns about the potential erosion of democratic values due to unaccountable technological governance. Additionally, notions like "digital doubles" and "neurocapitalism" point to the future development of technologies that could further manipulate consumer behavior and diminish individual autonomy.

While some trends in the digital economy lead toward authoritarian control mechanisms, alternative approaches advocate for participatory governance, collective intelligence, and community-driven resource management. Open initiatives such as open data and open-source platforms promote collaboration, facilitating the emergence of a more sustainable and equitable economy. 

To manage modern socio-economic systems effectively, the text proposes embracing multi-dimensional economic frameworks that move beyond one-size-fits-all monetary metrics. By integrating diverse forms of feedback and incentivizing positive externalities, we can cultivate an economy that emphasizes resilience, sustainability, and inclusivity.

Ultimately, the evolution towards a new economic landscape offers the potential for symbiotic relationships between technology and society, providing a basis for collective prosperity rather than scarcity. The digital age represents an opportunity to align economic practices with democratic principles, empowering individuals and communities while leveraging the capabilities of technology for social good.
