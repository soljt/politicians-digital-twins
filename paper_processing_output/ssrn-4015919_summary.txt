Segregation in urban environments significantly influences intergroup violence, particularly in contested spaces like Jerusalem. The debate centers on whether rival groups should be separated or integrated, with empirical evidence supporting both perspectives. Instances from cities such as Belfast and Ahmedabad suggest that segregation can mitigate violence by reducing direct contact between groups, while other examples, like those from Nairobi and the UK, indicate that high levels of segregation may contribute to racial tensions and civil unrest.

The conflicting views center around contact theory, which posits that increased interaction fosters better relations among groups. However, this relationship is complex and contingent on pre-existing social distances—defined as the perceived differences among groups in aspects like ethnicity and class. Positive interactions might reduce prejudice, but when groups perceive themselves in opposition, encounters can escalate to conflict. Scholars emphasize that conditions, such as equal status and shared goals, need to be met for intergroup contact to be beneficial.

Our research utilizes an agent-based model grounded in microlevel, geocoded data to assess how different scenarios of segregation and integration could shape violence patterns in Jerusalem. Key findings show that social distance, beyond mere spatial arrangements, is crucial in understanding urban violence. While integration may alleviate conflict in environments with minimal social distance, localized segregation and restricted mobility can mitigate violence in communities with heightened social distance.

The model simulations reveal that the level of intergroup contact and the consequent arrangements can significantly impact violence outcomes. When testing several counterfactual scenarios concerning Jerusalem's future—ranging from maintaining the status quo to complete re-partition in line with the 1967 borders—the findings indicate distinct levels of violence associated with varying degrees of segregation. Specifically, comprehensive strategies targeting social distance and fostering mutual respect may be necessary to achieve long-term conflict mitigation.

In conclusion, addressing violence in urban settings does not hinge solely on spatial integration or segregation but must consider the deeper social dynamics at play. Therefore, decisions surrounding peacebuilding and urban planning ought to be informed by empirical research that evaluates the potential impacts on intergroup relations and violence. The model underscores that successful interventions will require recognizing the fluidity of interactions among individuals and the fluctuations of social distance within the urban fabric.
