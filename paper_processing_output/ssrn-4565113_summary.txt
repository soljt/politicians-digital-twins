This study explores citizen perception of future street scenarios using virtual reality (VR) to assess how flexible street designs could be accepted. Traditional street design has been heavily focused on accommodating vehicular traffic, often neglecting pedestrians and evolving urban needs. The current design paradigm allocates significant space for cars based on expected peak-hour flows, which does not reflect the dynamic demands of urban life. The project investigates how unconventional street layouts impact perceived safety and acceptance, especially as urban areas increasingly seek to repurpose street space for sustainable transportation and public use.

Participants explored various street designs in a controlled VR environment, including a conventional setup, an "inLED" dynamic pavement design, and a "curbless" design that merges pedestrian and vehicular spaces. The findings indicate a strong preference for familiar street layouts. The unconventional designs, particularly the curbless scenario, were perceived as unsafe and contributed to higher stress responses, emphasizing the importance of familiarity and perceived safety in urban design. When exposed to new street layouts, participants expressed concerns about safety, often highlighting the cognitive effort required to navigate new environments, which aligns with the status quo biasâ€”a tendency to favor existing conditions over change.

Communication strategies were also a focal point of the research. Participants who viewed designs in a split-screen format tended to focus on the drawbacks of novel scenarios more than those who viewed them sequentially. This suggests that comparative communication has the potential to shape perceptions negatively. Overall, the study underscores the need for inclusive and participatory urban planning processes that account for diverse citizen perspectives, ensuring that street designs cater to a broad range of user needs.

The findings advocate for urban planning that emphasizes safety, comfort, and accessibility for all road users. By prioritizing a user-centered approach, planners can reconcile the tensions inherent in reallocating street space from cars to more inclusive uses. Future street designs should also incorporate clear visual cues to assist in navigating these spaces, ensuring that drivers and pedestrians alike understand their roles and responsibilities.

In essence, successful innovation in urban street design hinges on addressing community needs and preferences while mitigating the stress that comes from navigating unfamiliar environments. This research provides critical insights into how urban designs can better accommodate the evolving dynamics of city life, paving the way for more sustainable and equitable transportation systems.
