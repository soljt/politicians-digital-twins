The exploration of mechanisms in social dilemma contexts often assumes perfect observability of player contributions, which is rarely accurate in real-world applications. In this study, we investigated the implications of “fuzzy” mechanisms—an inherent imprecision in the grouping of contributors modeled through a contribution-based group formation mechanism. This mechanism aims to group high contributors with other high contributors while pairing low contributors together.

Our main hypothesis suggested a tradeoff between efficiency and equality: high levels of fuzziness would result in low efficiency but perfect equality, while decreased fuzziness would boost efficiency at the risk of increasing inequality. However, our findings revealed an unexpected outcome: reduced fuzziness not only improved efficiency but also enhanced equality.

In the context of our experiments, we utilized a variant of the contribution-based competitive grouping mechanism dubbed “meritocratic matching.” This approach allows us to analyze outcomes with different variance levels affecting how contributions are perceived and grouped. Through extensive laboratory and online experiments, we determined that even when mechanisms were fuzzy to a significant degree, the introduction of meritocratic matching led to welfare gains—increased efficiency correlated with a more equitable distribution of payoffs.

In terms of performance, our results indicated that players gravitate toward asymmetric equilibria where a majority contribute fully while a minority free-rides, thus generating a high overall contribution level. Importantly, our experimental results challenge established theoretical predictions regarding the efficiency-equality tradeoff. While classical theories predicted that meritocracy would yield greater inequality, our evidence pointed to the contrary, with performance improving equally across different meritocratic regimes.

Furthermore, our research emphasizes the relevance of monitoring faults and human behavior in the function of social mechanisms. Real-world applications often encounter noise; thus, our insights carry significant implications for policymakers considering mechanisms designed to foster cooperation. If social conditions are equitable from the outset, implementing meritocratic matches—even with considerable fuzziness—could result in universally favorable welfare outcomes.

Another critical finding emphasizes the behavioral responses of individuals based on experiences of fairness within the established grouping mechanism. Players adjusted their contributions depending on perceived meritocratic fairness, highlighting the importance of social preferences in contributing behavior. This suggests that individuals not only value their material payoffs but also weigh fairness in their strategies.

In summary, our findings advocate for the meritocratic matching mechanism as an effective institutional model that can promote cooperation and efficiency while also maintaining fairness among group members. This contributes to the broader discourse on economic equality and mechanisms in the social sciences, encouraging future research to refine our understanding of mechanism design under uncertainty and imprecision.
