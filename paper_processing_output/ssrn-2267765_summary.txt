Biological competition is traditionally associated with the development of selfish preferences, epitomized by the notion of 'homo economicus' in mainstream economics. However, the existence of other-regarding preferences is well-documented through experimental and field studies. A theory is proposed which reconciles both self-regarding and other-regarding preferences by examining the influence of intergenerational migration on evolutionary outcomes. Under conditions that favor non-cooperative behavior, our model suggests that evolutionary forces can yield either 'homo economicus' or 'homo socialis', depending on the contexts of interaction and migration patterns.

The model involves spatially interacting agents engaged in iterations of the prisoner’s dilemma, inheriting traits linked to 'friendliness.' It shows that while mutations may dilute such traits, cooperation can emerge from repeated interactions that promote reciprocal altruism. In social dilemmas, despite pressures towards individual success through free-riding, humans often display genuine concern for others, contradicting traditional economic theories that emphasize strict self-interest.

Contrary to models previously reliant on kin or group selection, our approach does not necessitate these mechanisms and focuses instead on individual strategy updates based on perceived utilities. The genetic or cultural transmission of 'friendliness' among agents is vital for the model's success, and offspring’s friendliness tends to regress toward more self-serving orientations. 

Simulation results reveal that, starting from a state of complete defectiveness, the introduction of mutations can lead to increasing levels of cooperation and 'friendliness.' A critical threshold of friendliness encourages unconditional cooperation among agents, while insufficient levels lead to the dominance of selfish behaviors. However, local reproduction plays a crucial role in catalyzing a transition from self-regarding to other-regarding preferences, promoting clustering of friendly agents and significantly enhancing the viability of cooperative behaviors.

This research ultimately posits that the evolution of human preferences may be shaped by a combination of environmental conditions, particularly migration and local reproduction patterns. It advances the idea that both self-interested and altruistic behaviors can arise from similar evolutionary processes, suggesting that conditions promoting cooperation can lead to emergent social behaviors within networks. 

In conclusion, our findings support a more nuanced understanding of human nature and economic behavior, highlighting the significance of local contexts and interactions. Rather than being purely driven by self-interest, economic theories should incorporate models of 'networked minds' that acknowledge the interconnectedness of individual preferences and behaviors, particularly in contemporary information-driven societies. This perspective encourages the development of an economic theory that better reflects the complexity of human social behavior, thus fostering interdisciplinary research to address societal challenges effectively.
