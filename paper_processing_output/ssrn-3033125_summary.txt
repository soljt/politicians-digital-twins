This paper explores the dynamics of voluntary contribution games, a classic scenario where individual strategies can lead to suboptimal outcomes for the collective. It emphasizes the notion that when agents are matched based on their contributions—a process known as assortative matching—more efficient contributions can emerge compared to random matching arrangements. The authors investigate how variations in individual budgets and public-good provision efficacy affect these contributions, particularly focusing on the implications of introducing heterogeneity into the budget distribution.

Assortative matching facilitates the emergence of high-efficiency equilibria, as individuals who contribute more are placed in groups with similar contributors. This method aligns individual incentives with collective goals, leading to better overall outcomes. However, a critical question remains regarding the robustness of these positive predictions when considering budget heterogeneity among players.

The study analytically demonstrates that the impact of allowing budget heterogeneity can significantly undermine the advantages conferred by assortative matching. Specifically, if players have different initial endowments, it becomes challenging to sustain multiple equilibria where players contribute equally. The theoretical framework indicates that, under conditions of heterogeneity, equilibria that hinge on high contributions tend to collapse, reverting instead to less favorable outcomes, including full non-contribution which reflects a classic tragedy of the commons scenario.

Using both analytical and computational approaches, the authors quantify efficiency loss resulting from heterogeneity. Ultimately, they find that conditions surrounding public-good provision efficacy and the degree of population inequality are pivotal in determining whether assortative matching leads to enhanced or diminished outcomes compared to homogeneous scenarios. 

The paper concludes that while assortative matching can yield considerable gains under certain conditions, the benefits can be substantially compromised by heterogeneity in player endowments and incentives. Therefore, policies aimed at ensuring equality of opportunities and contributions may be as crucial as implementing assortative matching mechanisms to achieve optimal collective outcomes in public goods provision. The findings underscore the necessity for careful consideration of individual differences in resources when modeling cooperation dynamics within groups, as assumptions of homogeneity can lead to misguided predictions about collective action and efficiency.
