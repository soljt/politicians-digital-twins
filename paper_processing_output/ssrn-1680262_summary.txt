The paper advocates for a new research program in socio-economic sciences, drawing parallels with the Hilbert Program in mathematics. It aims to address substantial gaps in mainstream economics exposed by the recent financial crises while identifying weaknesses in traditional economic approaches. This involves recognizing the need for improved decision support and policy advice based on a better understanding of economic phenomena.

The authors emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaborations, suggesting that insights from physics, biology, computer science, and social sciences can enhance economic research. They argue for a systemic understanding of interconnected socio-economic systems, proposing that utilizing available data and computer systems can facilitate rapid advancements in understanding these complexities.

The paper identifies various real-world challenges including demographic changes, financial instability, social inclusion, power balances in a multipolar world, collective social behavior, security issues, institutional design, and public health. Each of these challenges reflects systemic interdependencies that defy easy solutions.

Fundamental methodological challenges are highlighted, notably the need to reevaluate the traditional assumptions of economic rationality and the oversimplified models that ignore human cognitive limitations, irrational behaviors, and socio-economic diversity. The concept of the homo economicus as the 'perfect egoist' is critiqued for its unrealistic portrayal of human behavior. The authors call for a shift towards recognizing bounded rationality, where individuals make satisficing rather than optimizing decisions.

The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) and the equilibrium paradigm are also scrutinized. The EMH's validity is questioned in light of known market failures, suggesting that financial markets do not inherently lead to optimal outcomes. The equilibrium theory's assumptions are seen as too simplistic to capture the dynamic, often chaotic nature of economic interactions.

Furthermore, linear models are critiqued for their limitations in understanding complex systems, while the representative agent approach is deemed inadequate due to its neglect of heterogeneity and interaction effects among agents. The authors stress the relevance of capturing non-linear behaviors, network interactions, and emergent phenomena in socio-economic modeling.

Psychological and social factors, such as emotions and social norms, are highlighted as important elements that shape economic behavior. The authors urge an integration of these human factors into economic theories to facilitate a more accurate understanding of decision-making processes.

The role of information in economic dynamics is deemed critical, yet poorly addressed in existing models. The authors assert the need for a comprehensive theory of information relevance to guide economic understanding.

In conclusion, the paper posits that overcoming these challenges requires innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that merge various scientific insights. By doing so, economics can evolve to better address contemporary socio-economic problems, enabling more effective predictions and solutions for future crises. Overall, the authors advocate for a transformative shift in economic research priorities to incorporate complexity, non-linearity, and a better understanding of human behavior.
