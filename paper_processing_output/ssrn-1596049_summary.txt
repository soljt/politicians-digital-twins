The study of bargaining in the context of the ultimatum game has traditionally focused on the division of monetary "windfall gains." This approach has often led to conclusions about human behavior that may not accurately reflect real-world situations. Our experiment shifts the focus to bargaining over time, a more realistic scenario where participants must divide a waiting period, which highlights the inherent conflict in these negotiations without the usual monetary endowments.

By substituting time for money, we eliminate some biases associated with windfall gains that may lead to overly generous offers. This switch is significant because time represents a more natural cost, and individuals feel a tangible loss when it is at stake. Our design included variations in anonymity conditions to explore the effects of privacy on behavior, revealing that in a double-blind scenario, where neither the proposer nor the responder knows who they are interacting with, offers still tended to be fair.

Contrary to our hypothesis that anonymity would reduce other-regarding behavior, the results confirmed a tendency towards fairness similar to what has been observed in monetary bargaining. Notably, the modal offer was consistently around half of the total waiting time, suggesting that even when stakes are framed as losses, individuals are reluctant to impose unfair conditions on others. Only a single offer was rejected during the experiment, indicating a strong preference for maintaining equitable outcomes.

The findings point to the conclusion that individuals consider the social implications of their decisions, even under anonymity. This contrasts with expectations from prospect theory, where it is typically assumed that individuals would behave more selfishly when facing losses. We found little evidence supporting the notion that anonymity leads to a increase in selfish behavior, and our experiment demonstrated that social considerations weigh heavily in decision-making, regardless of the anonymity level.

The analysis suggests that the dynamics of social preferences remain robust across different scenarios, confirming that people are inclined to cooperate and share when the context reflects their social environment, whether dealing with money or time. Furthermore, our experimental design opens avenues for further research in experimental economics, particularly regarding the impact of anonymity and real losses on bargaining behavior. 

In summary, our work emphasizes the value of understanding human interactions in economic games beyond monetary exchanges. It highlights the complexity of social preferences and the importance of context in shaping the responses and decisions of individuals in bargaining situations. Future research could build on this foundation, exploring various dimensions of negotiation and fairness in more nuanced ways.
