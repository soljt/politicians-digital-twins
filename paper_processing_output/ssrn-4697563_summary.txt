The rapid urbanization in cities globally necessitates a re-evaluation of existing transportation infrastructures to address increasing demands from vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. Traditional road network designs often ignore the flexibility needed to accommodate mixed traffic flow. Research has primarily focused on optimizing traffic signals, while dynamic adaptations to street space and right-of-way allocations have been underexplored. 

Proposed here is a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach, referred to as CALM (Cooperative Adaptable Lanes Model), which seeks to enhance traffic flow and safety for vulnerable road users through cooperative adaptability of lane widths and access permissions. By employing multiple cooperative RL agents trained on mixed temporal data, this methodology determines optimal lane widths for various traffic types and creates safe co-sharing conditions for pedestrians and cyclists. 

Simulations revealed a significant reduction in average waiting times and queue lengths, outperforming static and heuristic models. The adaptability of CALM is crucial as it enables real-time responses to changing traffic conditions, thereby minimizing congestion and enhancing safety. Importantly, adapting street space dynamically promotes inclusivity and equity among road users by addressing inequalities in spatial allocation.

The integration of CALM with tools like the SUMO traffic simulator and open-source environments allows for rigorous evaluation and validation of the proposed model. Effectively, the adaptive lane framework demonstrates that shared spaces, while beneficial for promoting active transport, require careful management to prevent conflicts, particularly at higher densities. 

Previous urban design strategies often prioritized motor vehicle flows at the expense of alternative uses, leading to oversized roadways that limited the promotion of active transport. In contrast, the CALM framework advocates for a balance between managing vehicle traffic and creating pedestrian-friendly environments, which is critical in leveraging limited urban space efficiently.

The study highlights the necessity of incorporating adaptability into urban infrastructure design. The traditional static approach to street design must evolve to accommodate a diverse array of transportation modes while balancing mobility, safety, and comfort. A cooperative multi-agent system allows for more effective management of lane allocations and fosters a safer shared space for all users while minimizing environmental impacts due to reduced congestion and emissions.

Future research should continue to refine the methodology, exploring its application across larger networks and utilizing data-driven, flexible policies for urban mobility. This could lead to a more sustainable, connected, and inclusive urban transport system that addresses contemporary challenges posed by urban growth and mixed traffic scenarios.
