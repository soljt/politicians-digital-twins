Cooperation among selfish individuals can emerge spontaneously even in noisy environments, challenging views that emphasize the need for strong social institutions to achieve social order. Traditional models like the prisoner's dilemma suggest that rational actors will always defect, leading to suboptimal outcomes. However, our findings indicate that cooperation can prevail through local interactions and strategic migration, where individuals seek better "neighborhoods" based on past interactions. This success-driven migration is crucial for fostering and stabilizing cooperative behavior.

Our model demonstrates that when individuals are allowed to move based on the success of their interactions with neighbors, they can escape from uncooperative environments and explore more conducive ones for collaboration. We observe that the combination of imitation and mobility creates resilient cooperative clusters, which adapt and resist invasion by defectors. In contrast, removing mobility can severely hinder the survival of cooperative strategies, as it allows defector strategies to flourish unchecked.

The concept of "neighborhood testing" plays a significant role in our model, where individuals assess potential new locations before migrating. Through minor investments in exploring alternatives, individuals engage in fictitious play that leads to informed decisions about their social environment. This exploration contrasts with population dynamics under random relocation, which tend to disrupt cooperation and promote defector dominance.

We find that success-driven migration acts as a robust mechanism to form and maintain cooperation amidst various stochastic influences. Even while numerous factors threaten to undermine cooperation, such as strategic mutations and environmental noise, the proactive search for beneficial interactions enables the emergence of cooperation. Our results emphasize the importance of spatial structures and the interaction of strategic behavior and individual mobility.

Moreover, our simulations show that cooperative clusters can develop spontaneously, leading to an outbreak of predominant cooperation in contexts initially dominated by defectors. When conditions align, even a minority of cooperators can trigger a tipping point that shifts the overall dynamics towards widespread collaboration. This indicates that the mobility of individuals is not merely a disruption of social ties but is essential for the establishment and evolution of cooperative behaviors.

Overall, the persistence of cooperation, despite individual tendencies toward selfishness, suggests that migration and local interactions are pivotal in the evolution of socially beneficial behavior. The implications of this research extend beyond theoretical modeling and contribute to our understanding of social dynamics and cooperation in various real-world scenarios, including urban environments and organizational contexts. Addressing how mobility influences cooperation can provide insights into fostering more collaborative social structures without necessitating extensive changes to the incentive frameworks traditionally employed in cooperative dilemmas.
