Indoor air quality (IAQ) is a critical public health issue since individuals spend the majority of their time indoors. Poor IAQ can lead to significant health problems, including respiratory diseases and has been linked to increased risks during pandemics. Despite its importance, there is a notable lack of effective monitoring and awareness about indoor air quality compared to outdoor air quality, which has received more research attention.

To address this gap, we implemented a co-created citizen science approach in Zurich that actively involves citizens in the research process. This methodology empowers communities to participate in IAQ monitoring from its inception to data interpretation, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility. By utilizing stakeholder mapping and value-sensitive design, we aimed to enhance the ethical standards and inclusivity of data collection processes.

Traditional IAQ monitoring methods have been limited by expensive equipment and expert requirements, which can disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. Citizen science offers a compelling solution by making use of low-cost sensors and community involvement, thus democratizing the monitoring process and encouraging proactive, informed decision-making about indoor environments.

Our project demonstrated that engaging citizens not only helps gather localized data on IAQ but also provides a framework for effective interventions aimed at improving indoor environments. This participatory framework enhances the research process by incorporating diverse perspectives and insights, thereby addressing challenges in identifying pollution sources and informing policy actions more effectively.

Throughout our initiative, we emphasized ethical considerations such as data ownership, privacy, and trust between researchers and participants. Establishing clear protocols regarding data handling and transparency around technology is crucial to foster collaboration and maintain the integrity of community involvement.

The results of our IAQ monitoring campaign revealed significant differences in pollutant levels, particularly particulate matter, across various indoor environments. These findings underscore the necessity for tailored interventions that focus specifically on indoor air quality, considering unique sources such as cooking and household cleaning.

Additionally, the integration of citizen-collected data with official monitoring enhances the granularity of air quality assessments, enabling a more nuanced understanding of pollution dynamics. Such collaboration can lead to better public health outcomes and stimulate community engagement in environmental stewardship.

Ultimately, our study highlights the potential of a co-created citizen science approach to transform IAQ monitoring into a community-centered effort. It provides a structured yet flexible model that balances scientific rigor with social relevance, promoting a multi-stakeholder collaboration aligned with sustainable urban development goals. The insights gained from our approach point toward future initiatives that not only address IAQ issues but also contribute to broader environmental health objectives.
