The study of memes in citation networks provides a novel lens through which scientific information can be understood and analyzed. Memes are not merely catchy phrases or trends; they represent units of cultural information that propagate through imitation, similar to genetic replication. In the realm of scientific literature, memes emerge as specific phrases or concepts that are frequently cited and reproduced in subsequent works. Our assessment reveals a straightforward relationship between the frequency of meme occurrences and their propagation through citation graphs.

This work draws upon an extensive dataset, comprising nearly 50 million publication records, to validate our proposed framework for identifying and scoring scientific memes. The meme score is a critical metric that combines frequency of occurrence with a propagation score, thus allowing us to quantify the degree to which scientific concepts are not only present in academic discourse but also actively cited and discussed. This distinctive approach avoids relying on linguistic nuances or arbitrary thresholds, making it universally applicable across various fields of research.

Specific examples of scientific memes, such as "quantum," "graphene," and "self-organized criticality," illustrate how certain terms represent significant concepts within their respective disciplines. By investigating citation networks, we uncover community structures that reveal how these memes cluster around specific scientific topics, reflecting both collaborative patterns and the evolution of scientific ideas.

Interestingly, our research suggests that meme dynamics mirror broader patterns observed in cultural meme propagation, including competition for attention and the inherent volatility in meme popularity. Memes rise and fall in prominence as academic interests shift, emphasizing the ongoing nature of scientific discourse and inquiry.

Our findings critically highlight that existing metrics fail to capture the full essence of scientific memes. Through meticulous comparison with human annotations and alternative scoring methods, the meme score demonstrates substantial agreement with expert evaluations, showcasing its effectiveness as a new metric for analyzing scientific literature.

Moreover, we find that the top-ranked memes possess a compelling characteristic: while frequent words dominate the landscape of scientific writing, the most interesting memes tend to be those that balance frequency and citation propagation in unique ways. Such patterns suggest that science develops through a complex interplay of ideas that evolve over time.

Looking to the future, we posit that the framework for studying scientific memes can be expanded beyond rigid textual analysis. Incorporating linguistic and ontological approaches could enhance our ability to understand the abstraction and evolution of ideas in the academic sphere. By advancing this line of inquiry, we open avenues for deeper investigations into information diffusion, scientific innovation, and the dynamics of intellectual progress. The reflection of cultural and scientific evolution through the lens of memes offers a compelling framework for understanding how human knowledge grows, adapts, and ultimately transforms within the vast landscape of academia.
