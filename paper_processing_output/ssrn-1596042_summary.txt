The dynamics of traffic flow in urban road networks are complex and often modeled using computer simulations, revealing important relationships between vehicle density, flow, and network performance. Traditional traffic flow theory, influenced by principles from fluid dynamics, has typically relied on fundamental laws relating key indicators such as speed, density, and flow. The macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) is instrumental here, suggesting that flow increases with density until reaching capacity, beyond which congestion ensues. 

However, this approach often fails to fully capture the intricate patterns observed in urban settings, particularly in congested conditions where measurements typically scatter. Evidence from cities like Yokohama indicates the existence of a well-defined MFD that correlates space-mean flow and density with low scattering. A key breakthrough in understanding traffic performance lies in recognizing that spatial variability of vehicle densities is crucial. Variability elucidates the reasons behind fluctuations in network flow, even with constant average density and demand, and is primarily driven by the inhomogeneity of traffic across the urban landscape.

The research presents new methods for simulating destination flows without requiring detailed origin-destination tables, enabling a better understanding of urban-scale traffic dynamics. As vehicles navigate the network, their turning behaviors—and resultant link densities—significantly impact congestion patterns. In particular, flows quantification allows for a more realistic distribution of traffic, revealing that high spatial variability correlates with diminished network performance.

Our findings emphasize that the existence of an invariant MFD is contingent upon revealing the standard deviation of vehicle density as a key variable. By understanding how spatial variability influences traffic flow, we can elucidate the sometimes extreme fluctuation of flow rates in urban systems. For example, the model demonstrates that average network flow can range widely—from free flow conditions to near gridlock—despite comparable average vehicle densities.

Moreover, different levels of spatial inhomogeneity lead to large variations in congestion, primarily driven by the nature of full links in a road network. Full links restrict outflow from upstream links, demonstrating how growing congestion can rapidly hinder network performance. In practical terms, this means strategies aimed at reducing the number of fully occupied links—such as prioritizing traffic at critical intersections or implementing restrictions in high-density areas—can effectively enhance traffic performance.

As urban networks are complex and dynamically evolving, future research should explore these relationships further by examining different road configurations and congestion responses. The objective is not only to refine our traffic models but to develop insightful traffic management strategies that can alleviate congestion even as traffic patterns evolve. Ultimately, empirical studies are needed to validate these findings and to ensure that theoretical performance predictions are robust across varying spatial and temporal demand profiles.
