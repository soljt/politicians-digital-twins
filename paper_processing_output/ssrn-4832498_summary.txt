The increasing efforts to enhance citizen involvement in political decision-making underscore the significance of participatory budgeting (PB). PB offers a framework for enabling communities to propose projects and determine how public funds are allocated, embodying democratic values through the active participation of residents. However, while PB fosters inclusivity, it can inadvertently marginalize minority groups, as the power dynamics often favor larger groupsâ€”this is particularly evident in voting systems that produce outcomes reflecting the "tyranny of the majority."

To address this imbalance, we propose the integration of collective intelligence (CI) within PB processes. CI has demonstrated that groups can often exceed the problem-solving abilities of individual experts, suggesting that citizens can collaboratively identify and solve local issues more effectively. Yet, when CI is naively combined with PB, the quality of solutions often reflects the size of the voting group, leading to inequalities. 

Our approach advocates for a shared knowledge base that records partial solutions, enabling minority groups to benefit from the work of larger groups. This mutual enhancement not only fosters fairness for minorities but also improves the overall quality of solutions for all involved. The concept is rooted in the idea that many community projects share common elements, which can be reused across different initiatives, thus promoting an open innovation model that prioritizes information sharing.

In analyzing the disparities arising from group sizes within PB, we found that while proportional methods provide equitable budget distribution, they do not inherently guarantee equality in solution quality. A common example illustrates that a larger group working on a proposed project will likely yield more developed and higher-quality solutions due to greater expertise and resource availability. To ensure fairness, it is crucial to implement structures that account for these dynamics, which we explore through mathematical models and agent-based simulations.

The models show varying levels of efficiency and equity among different knowledge base strategies. For example, when groups do not share or save their solutions across initiatives, they experience low utility and high inequality. Conversely, when solutions are preserved but not shared, efficiency increases, yet inequality remains unaddressed. The model that allows for the sharing of all partial solutions between groups achieves both high efficiency and fairness. This arrangement not only diminishes hierarchical barriers but also promotes social cohesion.

A particularly salient benefit of this collaborative approach is its potential to counter social polarization by emphasizing shared contributions to community projects. The anticipated outcomes align with broader initiatives aimed at reducing inequality, such as the United Nations' focus on trustworthy AI and closing the digital divide. 

In summarizing our findings, we advocate for a participatory budgeting framework bolstered by collective intelligence, emphasizing the necessity of a shared knowledge structure that enhances both the diversity of solutions and equitable outcomes. Future research should further investigate the roles of technology, expertise, and broader community engagement, ensuring that participatory mechanisms are both effective and genuinely representative of all community members.
