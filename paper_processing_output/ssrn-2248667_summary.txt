The adherence to social norms is often perceived as a mechanism to promote cooperation and harmony within society; however, this perspective neglects the potential for norms to generate conflict. Our research focuses on understanding how normative conflicts arise, particularly when cooperative intentions at the micro-level fail to translate into cooperative outcomes at the macro-level.

We differentiate between two primary types of normative conflict. One arises from divergent expectations regarding how normative obligations should be fulfilled, while the other emerges from conflicts concerning the restraint of self-interest by norms. Our experiments illustrate that these conflicts are prevalent across various groups, such as egoistic, equity, and equality actors, highlighting that differing interpretations of fairness can disrupt cooperation even when intentions are aligned.

An analysis reveals that social norms are not solely cohesive; they can exhibit disintegrative characteristics. Various examples from academia demonstrate how conflicting norms regarding authorship and publication practices can lead to ongoing disputes, hindering fruitful collaboration. Moreover, our theoretical framework posits that normative conflict can lead to transaction failures, necessitating agreement on applicable norms for cooperation to succeed.

We employ a game-theoretical approach to model this conflict and introduce empirical designs that categorize individuals based on their adherence to specific normative types. By identifying two components of norms—content (what behavior is prescribed) and commitment (the extent to which self-interest should be sacrificed)—we explore how conflicts arise not only from differing normative contents but also from varying levels of normative commitment among actors.

The results from our ultimatum game experiments show that normative conflict is more frequently related to disagreements over normative content than over commitments. Additionally, our research reinforces the notion that the larger the discrepancy in perceived effort levels between actors, the greater the likelihood of conflict. 

We suggest that understanding the dynamic between social norms and individual interests is crucial to addressing both cooperation and conflict within varied systems. Cultural diversity in norms may enrich society by fostering creativity and adaptability, yet it simultaneously poses risks to social cohesion when conflicting expectations give rise to tensions.

In conclusion, norms can indeed generate conflict despite cooperative intentions, and addressing the intricacies of normative behavior is key to enhancing our understanding of social interactions and promoting effective cooperation in multifaceted environments. Future research should further investigate the interplay between material interests, normative adherence, and individual behavior to better navigate the complexities posed by normative conflicts.
