This research explores the application of spatial econometrics to estimate the impact of transforming office spaces into housing within the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona. The study emphasizes the need for effective origin-destination (OD) matrix modeling which is crucial for urban planning, yet often costly and time-consuming to establish. By using socio-demographic, land use, and topological data, the research introduces a robust spatial econometric method that accounts for spatial spillover effects, improving the estimation of traffic flows between different urban zones.

An innovative two-part Hurdle model with gradient boosting (XGBoost) is employed, effectively minimizing error rates while ensuring practical applicability for urban planning and policy-making. The findings suggest that the conversion of office space to residential use is likely to result in a reduction in vehicle trips, with predictions estimating a potential decrease of up to 8% in overall vehicular traffic, despite a concurrent increase in population density.

The paper argues that adaptive reuse of vacant office spaces addresses contemporary urban issues like housing shortages and sets the stage for improved urban mobility. Given the rise of teleworking, the conversion of offices might diminish travel demand even as housing needs intensify. The research underscores the modelâ€™s usefulness in predicting urban traffic flows resulting from land use changes, thereby highlighting the interplay between socio-economic trends and transportation dynamics.

Further, the study reveals that traditional models, such as gravity models, often fall short due to their static nature and assumptions of spatial independence. The proposed spatial econometric models overcome these shortcomings by incorporating explicit spatial variables and interdependencies among urban zones. This capability allows for a more nuanced understanding of mobility patterns and planning implications, enabling stakeholders to anticipate counterintuitive consequences of policy decisions.

In conclusion, the dual focus of this research on methodological innovation and real-world application stresses the importance of transparency and model explainability in urban planning processes. The findings advocate for integrating these models into participatory planning frameworks, such as urban digital twins, to facilitate stakeholder engagement and improve decision-making outcomes in urban redevelopment initiatives. This study serves as a critical contribution to the ongoing challenge of sustainable urban growth while accommodating increasing densification in metropolitan areas.
