As autonomous driving technologies evolve, there's a pressing need to reassess traditional urban traffic control and lane management methods. A strategic emphasis is on creating dedicated lanes for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), which can accommodate intermittent access for other vehicle types. While these dedicated lanes have shown some potential to improve road capacity and efficiency, they often assume an unrealistically uniform vehicle mix, ignoring the current reality of diverse traffic compositions featuring CAVs, Semi-Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs).

Research in this area has largely overlooked the nuances of mixed traffic environments, often focusing solely on CAVs operating in isolation. In contrast, it is essential to understand how these vehicles interact in real-world conditions, especially as we transition towards an environment where human-driven vehicles coexist with smart and autonomous alternatives. The need for effective lane management strategies grows increasingly critical to accommodate this diversity, prevent collisions, and optimize road usage.

Our proposed approach, FAIRLANE, utilizes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. This framework aims to enhance the fair utilization of priority lanes by considering factors such as driving comfort, efficiency, and safety during lane changing maneuvers. Our experiments demonstrate that with a CAV penetration rate below 40% and SAVs making up 50% of remaining traffic, this strategy greatly improves overall traffic efficiency compared to traditional methods. Specifically, it significantly reduces mean waiting times and increases average vehicle speeds, providing valuable insights into the implications of varying vehicle penetration rates for urban planners and policymakers.

Key challenges in current lane management strategies include underutilization of dedicated lanes during low penetration rates of prioritized vehicle types, and issues related to safety and equitable distribution of road space among differing vehicle types. Additionally, traditional centralized approaches, which assume compliance from all vehicles, fall short in addressing the disparities inherent in real-world driving behaviors and the varied levels of vehicle automation.

FAIRLANE's decentralized nature addresses these challenges by fostering effective communication among vehicles and adapting lane access dynamically. This system not only leverages V2V interactions but also integrates non-connected HDVs into the traffic ecosystem. Our findings indicate that a carefully constructed priority lane strategy can optimize road utilization while maintaining equitable traffic flow.

In summary, as urban environments transition to incorporate more CAVs, it is crucial to develop adaptive traffic management systems that are sensitive to the dynamics of mixed-traffic scenarios. For effective implementation of priority lanes, our research highlights the importance of considering real-time data and vehicle composition, notably that for optimal performance, CAV priority lanes should ideally be introduced when CAV penetration rates fall within the 20% to 40% range. Policymakers are encouraged to adopt a flexible approach in deploying traffic management strategies to match the evolving landscape of urban mobility. Future research directions include the need to model human driving behaviors more realistically to enhance mixed-traffic simulations and analyze the potential integration of public transit with CAV networks.
