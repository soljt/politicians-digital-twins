Diseases can induce resource constraints that significantly amplify the spread of epidemics, leading to explosive dynamics that standard models may overlook. As a disease becomes prevalent, the availability of medical resources, which rely on a healthy population, diminishes, hence interfering with effective treatment and recovery.

Traditional epidemiological models, like the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model, fail to account for the feedback loop where the epidemic reduces resources. Our modified budget-constrained SIS (bSIS) model demonstrates that when recovery costs rise above a critical threshold, an epidemic can escalate uncontrollably. This occurs despite predictions from standard models, where the interplay between infection and resource availability becomes crucial.

Resource constraints stem from the necessity of a healthy population to generate healing resources. Infected individuals not only need treatments but also rely on healthy individuals to maintain funding for healthcare systems through taxes and premiums. This relationship becomes critical in regions where economic productivity suffers due to endemic diseases, potentially leading to system collapses if healing resources are inadequate.

Through mathematical modeling and simulations, we identified that as healing costs exceed a critical value, the system can transition from a low epidemic phase to a high epidemic phase abruptly. This discontinuous shift accentuates the importance of timely interventions, as delaying treatment until infection levels rise significantly can lead to explosive outbreaks.

The findings indicate that the dynamics of disease spread can reflect different behaviors across various social networks. Our analysis on real friendship networks revealed that disease dynamics, including explosive transitions, are not solely confined to the assumptions of mean-field approximations but are persistent across diverse interaction structures. This highlights that both healing costs and the effective reproduction number of the disease are integral to understanding and mitigating epidemic risks.

The implications of this research extend beyond the biological realm, potentially informing responses to non-biological contagions in economics and social systems. Policy measures should closely monitor epidemic dynamics, expanding our focus from mere infection rates to the underlying resource constraints influencing recovery potential. Future work can explore how strategies can be effectively developed to manage resources optimally, thereby reducing the likelihood of explosive epidemic transitions.

In conclusion, addressing the interplay between resource generation and disease dynamics is essential for effective epidemic management. By recognizing the critical thresholds where health systems can become overwhelmed, we can improve strategies to contain outbreaks and protect public health.
