The evolution of cooperation among humans necessitates mechanisms that mitigate the exposure of cooperators to defectors. This premise is widely accepted, yet debates persist concerning which evolutionary mechanisms effectively explain the remarkable levels of cooperation observed in human societies. A central aspect of this discourse is the nature of the informational regularities that allow cooperators to evade exploitation.

Cooperation fundamentally relies on the ability of individuals to interact more frequently with those who share their cooperative tendencies. While genetic relatedness offers a clear explanation for cooperative behavior among kin, the challenge lies in understanding cooperation among genetically unrelated individuals, particularly in situations devoid of the possibility of reciprocation. As such, common mechanisms proposed include kin selection, direct reciprocity, and group-based selection. However, these frameworks often struggle to fully account for the complex nature of human cooperation in larger, less kin-centered groups.

Our research utilized a behavioral experiment designed to investigate whether the option to migrate away from less cooperative peers could foster enduring cooperation, even under conditions of limited information regarding potential interactions. Participants were given the opportunity to relocate within a network while playing a social dilemma without knowing their new partners' likely behaviors. Despite this uncertainty, we found that the mere choice to move promoted prolonged cooperation.

The results suggest that individuals participating in the choose-location treatment cooperated more than those in an assign-location treatment. Specifically, the decision to escape from less cooperative environments facilitated positive assortment, enabling cooperators to cluster together and shield themselves from defectors. As cooperation within these emerging neighborhoods became more stable, the payoffs for cooperators increased, effectively eliminating the previously observed disadvantages associated with cooperative behavior.

Interestingly, the mechanisms behind cooperation extended beyond mere partner choice; individuals did not necessarily move more frequently than defectors but did so in response to neighborhood composition. Cooperators tended to relocate away from lower-propensity cooperative surroundings, while defectors showed no such sensitivity. This nuanced movement pattern underpinned the emergence of positive assortment through self-selection, thus enhancing cooperative dynamics and limiting the incidence of free-riding.

Our findings have crucial implications for understanding human cooperation's evolution. The capacity to relocate away from unproductive social interactions can undermine selective pressures against cooperation, paving the way for group-level selection and collective cultural behaviors. However, while movement itself did not incur overt costs, the real-world implications of introducing such costs remain to be explored in future studies.

Furthermore, the dynamics of cooperation may vary as the scope of social interactions expands. Larger groups may necessitate additional mechanisms to sustain cooperation, particularly when genetic relatedness is low and indirect reciprocity is challenging. Reliable information about the social landscape and individualsâ€™ reputations could be instrumental in strengthening cooperation. Future research should delve into how strategic movements and the availability of information interact to promote cooperative behaviors in complex social settings.
