Panic-induced crowd behavior often leads to tragic outcomes, including fatalities during stampedes. This phenomena can occur in various contexts, from life-threatening emergencies like fires in crowded spaces to less severe situations such as rushes for seating at events. The frequency of crowd disasters appears to be growing alongside the size and number of mass gatherings. 

Most studies have approached panic behavior from a social psychology standpoint, but there's a lack of quantitative theories that can predict crowd dynamics during panic. By simulating pedestrian behavior with computational models, we can obtain insights into panic mechanisms and identify ways to mitigate the negative impacts of such events. Our findings indicate that an optimal escape strategy combines both individualistic and collective behaviors.

Panic behavior is characterized by several observable features: individuals often move faster than usual, physical interactions become prevalent, movement through bottlenecks turns chaotic, and crowd jams can create lethal pressures. Additionally, people may overlook alternative exits and tend to follow the actions of others, leading to maladaptive mass behaviors. 

Our model is based on a generalized force concept that accounts for both psychological and physical influences on pedestrian movements. Each person aims to reach a desired speed while maintaining a safe distance from others, which can be disrupted during high-stress situations. The behavior of crowds can exacerbate conditions, resulting in significant pressure build-up and the potential for injury or death. 

Our simulations reveal several critical insights. As desired walking speed increases, irregularities such as clogging become more likely. This phenomenon, known as the "faster-is-slower effect," suggests that in attempts to escape quickly, individuals inadvertently create conditions that slow down overall movement, particularly in emergencies like fires. 

To improve crowd safety, structural designs should avoid bottlenecks and consider emergency exit optimization. Additionally, our studies underscore the importance of individual choice in dynamics, demonstrating that neither pure individualism nor homogeneity leads to optimal outcomes. A blend of both behaviors allows for better utilization of exit routes.

We encourage further data collection on panic situations to refine our models and develop techniques that can predict crowd behavior more accurately. Our goal is to understand the mechanisms driving panic dynamics better, promoting the design of safer environments in public spaces. There exists a compelling need to balance personal decision-making with herd behavior to achieve the best outcomes in emergency scenarios.
