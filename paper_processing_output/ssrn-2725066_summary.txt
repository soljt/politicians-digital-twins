In exploring decentralized routing strategies, we examined the integration of local and non-local information in traffic networks. Our analysis reveals that local congestion awareness significantly enhances a network's resilience against congestion emergence compared to dynamic information dissemination methods. Specifically, relying on local information minimizes deviations from optimal routes, effectively steering agents away from localized congested areas.

Prior to congestion onset, local information routing proves optimal, enabling agents to navigate with minimal deviation from the shortest path. However, once congestion is imminent, models that incorporate dynamic information can maintain more fluid traffic flow initially. We identified an important transition from instability to stability driven by a memory parameter that correlates with the density transition field. When congestion emerges, local awareness facilitates a uniform density landscape, approximating the Wardrop equilibrium.

The increased attention to how information spread affects traffic dynamics arises from its implications on organizational and social frameworks. Prior studies focused on optimal routing models relying on centralized information, which are less applicable to large networks. Decentralized local approaches allow for more efficient routing through empathic strategies that consider both current congestion states and neighboring conditions.

Our work included a comparison of three specific routing mechanisms: no information (shortest-path routing), local congestion information, and a dynamical decentralized information system that adjusts based on user-generated inputs. The latter serves as a bridge between purely local and global routing strategies. Each model dynamically alters travel time estimates, thus enabling agents to respond to changing traffic conditions while factoring in both local and long-range information.

Simulation of these models on a 100-node square lattice demonstrated clear performance differences under increasing network inflow. Strikingly, local congestion-aware routing enabled the highest network inflow before congestion developed compared to other models. This observation underscores the potential detriment of long-range information, suggesting that excessive information dissemination can destabilize traffic systems by introducing higher variability in congestion patterns. 

Exploring the fundamental diagram, we noted that while dynamic routing mechanisms can initially delay congestion, they ultimately lead to suboptimal performance during peak inflow conditions. The fundamental relationships we derived emphasize that local information is often more effective in maintaining overall network stability. 

Consequently, our research supports a two-tiered policy framework for traffic management: utilizing local information when network densities are low and reverting to dynamic information strategies to manage traffic during periods of congestion. This mixed-method approach is anticipated to enhance overall network efficiency while minimizing congestion impacts. 

Our findings contribute to a broader understanding of traffic dynamics and advocate for adaptive routing methods that effectively leverage local information for real-world applications.
