The legitimacy of democratic processes is fundamentally tied to how citizens perceive voting methods and their outcomes. Confidence in political systems hinges on citizens' ability to express their preferences effectively, and the choice of voting methods can significantly influence this perception of legitimacy. This study examines how different voting methods—namely Majority Voting, Combined Approval Voting, Score Voting, and Modified Borda Count—affect legitimacy perceptions in both consequential (COVID-19-related issues) and non-consequential contexts (voting on colors).

Findings reveal that legitimacy perceptions are context-dependent. In critical societal contexts like COVID-19, more flexible voting methods tend to be favored, while simple methods like majority voting are preferred in trivial contexts. Additionally, consistent voters, who express stable preferences, are more inclined towards complex voting systems, while inconsistent voters lean towards straightforward methods. Notably, personal traits and voting consistency also shape perceptions of legitimacy.

The study provides insights on how to improve voting methods to enhance their legitimacy. Effective voting mechanisms need to align with the context and the population's preference patterns. Such methods should allow for comprehensive expression of voter preferences, which is vital for fostering democratic legitimacy. Moreover, the evaluation of legitimacy should consider multiple dimensions, including input (representation in the process), output (outcomes of governance), and throughput legitimacy (the fairness of the decision-making process).

Moreover, the research emphasizes that legitimacy is not a static quality but fluctuates based on the criticality of issues, timing, and voter engagement levels. For low-stakes questions, majority voting may suffice, but for high-stakes decisions, more advanced methods, like score voting, are perceived as more legitimate.

This work highlights the importance of further research in democratic decision-making frameworks, particularly on how various factors, such as preference polarization and the influence of information on voting behavior, can affect legitimacy elsewhere. By approaching voting methods with a focus on context and complexity of preferences, policymakers can enhance the perceived legitimacy of electoral outcomes, ultimately reinforcing democratic institutions and electoral integrity.
