Cooperation is crucial for societal functioning but is frequently undermined by individual self-interests. Despite extensive research in game theory, interactions across diverse social groups often face conflicts arising from differing norms and preferences. These dynamics necessitate a deeper examination of how cooperation can be fostered amid heterogeneity. 

We utilize replicator equations in game theory to analyze competitive interactions among multiple populations that possess incompatible interests and varying levels of power. Through this modeling approach, we address pivotal questions regarding the promotion of cooperation, the role of costly punishment, and the conditions under which cooperation fails, potentially leading to conflict or revolutions. 

Our findings reveal that social interactions characterized by incompatible interests do not invariably lead to conflict; in some cases, they may encourage mutual coordination. Specific parameters defining games—like the multi-population prisoner's dilemma, harmony games, and stag hunt games—produce distinct social dynamics. For instance, in a multi-population prisoner's dilemma, individuals tend to behave non-cooperatively, while harmony games tend to yield cooperative behaviors, albeit with a lack of coordination between groups.

We consider interactions where individuals display diverse preferences based on factors like gender, cultural background, and social status, recognizing that individuals may possess heterogeneously perceived norms. Notably, power dynamics play a significant role in shaping the outcomes of interactions between groups with differing preferences.

Our model demonstrates that achieving normative behavior often requires one group to abandon its preferred strategy in favor of the other. This scenario presents a problem of equilibrium selection, where the attraction of behavioral norms can waver depending on initial conditions or distributions of behaviors across populations.

In stag hunt games, instead of leading to consensus, populations often exhibit behavior that aligns with their individual preferences due to interactions, revealing a complex relationship between cooperation and the establishment of social norms. The presence of both self-interactions and interactions between populations complicates traditional notions of game-dynamics, potentially leading to the emergence of distinct socio-cultural norms in scenarios where populations have equal power.

The implications of our work extend beyond theoretical explorations. They provide insight into pressing societal issues, such as the emergence of norms, societal polarization, and even the mechanics behind revolutions. The evolving interactions among heterogeneous groups reflect the role of social norms in reducing uncertainty and guiding cooperation within and across diverse communities.

Understanding these dynamics can greatly benefit fields like economics, law, and social science, particularly concerning the stability and formation of social norms. Norms condense complex social behaviors into manageable patterns, explaining how cooperation and social cohesion can develop amidst competing interests. Future research avenues could delve into empirical studies testing these theoretical predictions, offering further clarity on the mechanisms fostering cooperation across tumultuous social landscapes.
