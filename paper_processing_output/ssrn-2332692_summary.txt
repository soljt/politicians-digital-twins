The evolution of the Internet and social media has fundamentally altered our decision-making processes. We are transitioning from being independent decision-makers to becoming interconnected social decision-makers, termed "homo socialis." This shift has far-reaching implications for economic theories and institutions, which must adapt to support this new form of decision-making rather than clinging to the outdated model of "homo economicus," characterized by self-interest.

The recent financial and public debt crises have heightened skepticism about mainstream economic theories, particularly the reliance on the "homo economicus" framework. Empirical studies increasingly show that the perfectly self-interested agent is the exception rather than the rule. In reality, human behavior is influenced by other-regarding preferences, suggesting that cooperation and fairness are inherent traits rather than anomalies. Such findings challenge the notion that markets, in their current form, promote ethical behavior.

The emergence of the "homo socialis" suggests that human beings, influenced by evolutionary forces, are naturally inclined to consider the well-being of others as part of their decision-making processes. Current economic theories frequently overlook this aspect, and as a consequence, they fail to account for real-world interactions where cooperation can lead to superior outcomes for all involved.

Moreover, economic institutions must evolve to reflect these social dynamics. The excesses of "homo economicus" in anonymous markets often hamper cooperation during social dilemmas. To create a more effective and equitable economy, we ought to design systems that promote reputation as a key factor in decision-making. Such systems could guide decisions toward socially beneficial outcomes while addressing the critical issues of environmental degradation and public good exploitation, often termed "tragedies of the commons."

Implementing reputation systems allows for a clearer framework where individuals and organizations are accountable for their actions in a manner that mirrors social community values. By fostering transparency and encouraging cooperative behavior, such systems could enable a self-regulating economy characterized by mutual benefit and reduced reliance on punitive regulations.

Additionally, the current trends in decentralized production and participatory economies—exhibited by movements like the sharing economy and co-production—signal the advent of a new participatory market society. Innovations in technology facilitate this transition, reflecting a shift towards more localized and personalized production that empowers individuals to contribute actively to the economy.

The necessary institutional changes beckon a shift from a top-down approach to a bottom-up self-regulating system. This model can effectively balance the interests of diverse stakeholders and manage externalities, promoting sustainability and fostering conditions conducive to cooperation, even in large and complex systems.

In essence, by acknowledging and harnessing the capabilities of the "homo socialis," we can revitalize economic theory and institutional designs. This shift is not just an improvement in efficiency; it represents a profound understanding of our nature as social beings. By fostering environments that encourage cooperation and other-regarding behaviors, we stand to tackle longstanding global challenges and build a more resilient and equitable society.
