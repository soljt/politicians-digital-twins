This work presents a theoretical framework for understanding the dynamic behavior of pedestrians, employing mathematical and physical modeling to correlate human movement with underlying laws. The focus is on the pedestrian's intended speed, which can be categorized into time-bound movements aimed at achieving specific goals or adhering to a schedule, and speed-bound movements characterized by predetermined velocities.

The study introduces key concepts such as desired speed—the optimal velocity for comfortable and efficient walking—and explores how pedestrians adapt their speeds dynamically based on situational contexts. Pedestrians exhibit distance-dependent interaction forces, which include repulsive forces to maintain personal space and attractive forces that draw individuals closer, particularly in social contexts.

Importantly, the work highlights the implications of spontaneous decision-making, allowing individuals to alter their paths based on changing environments or new points of interest. This flexibility illustrates that pedestrian behavior is not strictly governed by set rules but is subject to cognitive processes that weigh benefits and constraints, responding to time pressure and surrounding dynamics.

The model developed here identifies several emergent phenomena, particularly the "detour effect" where individuals increase their walking speed when faced with an unexpected increase in required distance. Additionally, the findings underline the aggressive walking behavior observed in crowded conditions which leads to the violation of personal space and can trigger collisions. The model explains how time pressure influences decisions, potentially resulting in collective behaviors such as queuing delays and crowd dynamics.

Through kinetic gas theory, the research formulates macroscopic equations describing the density, momentum, and energy of pedestrian flows. This framework extends traditional Navier-Stokes equations by incorporating terms specific to pedestrian interactions, such as time pressure effects and changes in group dynamics resulting from strategic movements. 

The impact of external factors such as road design and spatial layouts is also addressed. Optimal arrangements should minimize crossing paths, maintain organizational structure in movement, and ensure unobstructed flow to facilitate safe and efficient pedestrian transit. This research suggests practical applications in urban planning, including strategies to improve pedestrian experiences in crowded environments and prevent critical situation escalations during emergencies. 

Overall, this model not only captures the complex interplay of individual behavior in pedestrian settings but also serves as a foundation for quantitative sociology by delivering predictions that align with observed behaviors. Future research will likely focus on refining these predictions and exploring further implications on traffic planning and social dynamics in public spaces.
