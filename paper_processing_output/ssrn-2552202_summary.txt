This study investigates the influence of anonymity and power balance on sharing behavior in bargaining scenarios, particularly through the lens of the Ultimatum Game (UG). The UG presents a situation where one party proposes a division of resources and the other can accept or reject this offer, a context that traditionally examines self-regarding versus fairness-oriented preferences in decision-making.

The research highlights the adverse effects of anonymity in social exchanges. Anonymity can undermine cooperative behavior as it removes accountability, leading to incentives for selfish actions. However, contrary to expectations, instances of cooperative behavior can still emerge, like the self-organizing principles observed in platforms such as Wikipedia, where contributors are held accountable through transparent records.

We implemented a web-based experimental design with strict anonymity across three different treatments to manipulate the power balance between the proposer and the responder. The goal was to discern how these factors influenced players' proposals and responses. Initial theories suggested that increased anonymity would lead to less fair offers, allowing us to test existing behavioral theories against actual outcomes.

The findings reveal a complex heterogeneity in player behavior. While some players operate under selfish motives, others demonstrate fairness-oriented tendencies or adhere to context-sensitive principles, such as exercising the "power of the last word" to counter unfair proposals. Despite the confidentiality ensured in our experiments, a significant proportion of fair offers were still made, particularly in situations where power dynamics were altered.

The results challenge traditional economic rationality, suggesting modifications to established behavioral theories may be necessary to accommodate unexplained behaviors in bargaining dynamics. The observed rejection of relatively fair offers illustrates a potential psychological component at play, where responders utilize rejection as a means to assert control over the bargaining process.

Moreover, our analysis indicates that shared cooperation can still manifest under anonymity if social structures enable accountability in a way that fosters fair outcomes. This finding urges further examination into the conditional nature of cooperative behavior, particularly in anonymous environments.

Through rigorous experimental controls and analysis, our study underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of social dynamics in bargaining scenarios and the influence of psychological and contextual factors over mere rational choice considerations. Future research should delve deeper into these dynamics, particularly in varying contexts, to fully elucidate the complex interplay of anonymity, power, and social behavior in economic exchanges.
