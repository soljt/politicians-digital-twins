This study explores the dynamics of cooperation within spatial public goods games by introducing punishing strategies alongside traditional cooperation and defection strategies. The key focus lies in examining how two distinct punishing strategies—punishing cooperators (PC) and punishing defectors (PD)—affect the evolution of cooperation in these games.

In public goods games, individual actions that benefit personal gain often harm collective well-being, tempting free-riding behavior. The challenge is to identify mechanisms that promote cooperation despite this tendency. Punishment has emerged as a potentially effective method to sustain cooperation; however, its success hinges on structured interactions rather than random mixing. In well-mixed populations, punishing strategies tend to falter because the associated costs undermine their competitiveness. Yet, in spatially structured environments, punishment can significantly bolster cooperative behavior through different mechanisms depending on the nature of the punishing strategy employed.

Punishing cooperators (PC) can enhance cooperation levels as the punishment fine increases, ultimately driving non-punishing cooperators out of the population and addressing the problem of second-order free-riding. This occurs because PC strategies allow cooperators to segregate and cluster, enhancing their survival and efficacy in combating defectors. In contrast, punishing defectors (PD) relies on the cooperative behavior of others to be effective, requiring an optimal mixture with cooperators to thrive. Without this interplay, PD strategies falter when facing too high of a punishment fine, reverting the system back to states reminiscent of non-punished environments.

Interestingly, the research suggests a phase transition based on punishment levels where cooperation can initially flourish but may regress as fines become excessive. The interplay between punishment costs and fines produces critical thresholds that delineate the survival of different strategies. Understanding these dynamics reveals insights into cooperation's persistence and the role that structured interactions and punishment play in fostering social behavior.

Through computational simulations, the study reveals that while both punishing strategies can lead to increased cooperation, they do so via fundamentally different paths. Specifically, the presence of punishing cooperators can lead to an increase in cooperation by ousting free-riding strategies. In contrast, punishing defectors require the cooperative presence to sustain their own existence, demonstrating a critical alliance that must maintain a delicate balance to function effectively.

Overall, the findings underscore that while punishment can indeed promote cooperation, the delicate balance of strategy interactions and the costs associated with punishment must be carefully managed to prevent counterproductive outcomes. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of cooperativity mechanisms within structured populations, emphasizing the contextual dependency of strategy effectiveness in social dilemmas.
