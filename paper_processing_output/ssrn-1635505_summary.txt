The relationship between social inequality and cooperation is complex and often misunderstood. In this exploration, we challenge the traditional notion that inequality inherently hinders cooperative behavior. Instead, our findings suggest that under specific conditions, social inequality can actually enhance cooperation among individuals.

Our analysis uses a modified version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, incorporating local adaptations and varying payoffs that reflect differences in wealth among agents. In our model, individuals possess different levels of wealth that affect their potential gains and losses during interactions. This stands in stark contrast to traditional assumptions where individuals have equal payoffs, often leading to a pessimistic outlook on the sustainability of cooperation.

One of our key insights is that within an environment where the rich can accumulate wealth, cooperative strategies can thrive outside of complex behavioral frameworks or imposed strategies. This phenomenon, known as the "rich-get-richer" effect, allows cooperators to dominate over defectors under various conditions, marking a significant departure from classic evolutionary models where cooperation usually fails to prevail.

Through simulations, we found that the initial presence of defectors may initially discourage cooperation. However, as cooperators build wealth within cooperative networks, they become competitive against defectors. Consequently, these cooperators can quickly expand their influence and ultimately dominate the interaction landscape, leading to a resurgence of cooperative behavior. This emergence of cooperation in the presence of wealth inequality reveals a strikingly different dynamic when comparing our findings to classical models of the Prisoner’s Dilemma.

Furthermore, the extent of inequality plays a crucial role in determining cooperation levels. Greater initial inequality tends to promote cooperation, although the benefits diminish at very high levels of inequality. Similarly, the degree to which individuals invest in their wealth accumulates—reflected through the parameter controlling past payoffs—affects the likelihood of cooperation succeeding. Our results indicate that a moderate 'rich-get-richer' effect is preferable for maximizing cooperative outcomes.

In addition, our research suggests that larger populations may provide better survival odds for cooperation. A considerable number of individuals in a system increases the chances that one or more cooperative clusters survive initial exploitative phases, which is vital for long-term cooperative success.

Overall, this research emphasizes the potential benefits of social inequality in promoting cooperative behaviors rather than merely viewing inequality as a societal detriment. Recognizing how different types of social and economic arrangements can foster cooperation is essential, particularly in contexts informed by recent economic challenges. The implications extend to policy considerations surrounding income distribution and incentive structures, highlighting an intricate balance between inequality and social cohesion.
