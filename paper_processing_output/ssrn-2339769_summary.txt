The FuturICT project aims to utilize new scientific approaches and technologies to enhance sustainability and social well-being in a complex, interconnected world. It aspires to facilitate social self-organization, self-regulation, and resilience through innovative information and communication systems. A central goal is to empower individuals while fostering collective awareness about the impacts of human actions on our global environment.

To achieve these objectives, the project proposes the development of novel tools and frameworks, including a Planetary Nervous System (PNS) for real-time assessment of global states, a Living Earth Simulator (LES) to model potential scenarios, and a Global Participatory Platform (GPP) to encourage social interaction and engagement. These systems will allow us to mine and analyze large data sets effectively, leading to informed decision-making processes.

Modern society often grapples with complex challenges that arise from our interconnectedness, such as financial crises and pandemics. These phenomena underscore a series of gaps in our current understanding of socio-economic systems. The rapid evolution of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has transformed our capabilities, yet we struggle to manage their implications. A new paradigm of science and socially adaptive ICTs is essential for addressing these dynamics, fostering transparency, trust, and individual rights while promoting active participation in political and economic arenas.

FuturICT emphasizes the need to understand the emergent properties of complex systems, allowing us to shift focus from component analysis to the interactions and collective behaviors that define systemic characteristics. By recognizing these patterns, we can develop strategies to guide social cooperation and collaborative problem-solving, enhancing societal resilience and sustainability.

The initiative seeks to overcome traditional approaches to social challenges, which have often been ineffective due to their simplistic models of dynamic systems. Instead, a holistic understanding of the intricate interplay within human activities is vital to forge paths toward innovative solutions. The project aims to elevate the role of social sciences to that of natural sciences in terms of investment and priority.

A significant element of FuturICT is its ethical underpinnings, focusing on enhancing human well-being, increasing fairness, and protecting social capital. This involves creating environments where collective awareness of decision impacts can flourish, thus enabling citizens to anticipate potential outcomes and mitigate risks collaboratively.

Finally, the project presents an opportunity for Europe to lead in socially inspired innovations, addressing pressing global issues by fostering creativity and participation. It seeks to integrate different fields of study and practice, ultimately guiding the world toward a future marked by better-informed societal actions, effective governance, and the collective pursuit of sustainable development.
